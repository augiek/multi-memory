Hi, and welcome to multiMemories. This is a site I've been thinking about for some time as I am unable to travel (during Covid) to see my parents and grandparents, and have been wholly dependent on phone conversations to hear their stories and experiences (only a portion of which I will truly remember). I wanted to create an audio journaling app that would allow people to save their thoughts and memories for their friends, family, and posterity--forever. In other words, I wanted them to be able to tell their story in their own voice. I like to imagine that my grandkids could hear my grandparents telling stories about their childhoods. 

This is just v1.0, and it allows basic journaling and audio recording. But there is still a lot of work to do. Future releases will include many additional features, including sharing, searching, and more effective tagging of entries. 

Thank you for your interest in the site, and please feel free to reach out at atkw35@gmail.com, or find me on LinkedIn, to learn more. 

## Available Scripts

In the frontend directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. Unless the backend is also running, you'll just be able to view the user interface.

In the backend directory, you can run:

### `python manage.py runserver`

Starts the backend in development mode; allows you to save entries to the database and view old entries.\
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in the browser (but the real action is over at lh3000).

You may have to run "npm install" and/or "pip install -r requirements.txt" to get everything set before you launch the app.
